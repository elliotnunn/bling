# Bling

Bling is a GUI framework for small displays. Its only target is currently a Raspberry Pi stuffed inside a National Panasonic flip clock. Bling's main attractions are its (glitch-free!) double-buffered compositing windowing system, and its very threaded "actor-metaphor" event loop implementation.
